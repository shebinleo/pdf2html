## 4.3.1 (2025-07-05)

**Security Fixes**

- **Path Traversal:** Patched a path traversal vulnerability by ensuring all file processing occurs within a temporary directory. This prevents attackers from accessing or manipulating files outside of the intended directory.
- **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** Implemented HTML sanitization using `dompurify` to prevent potential XSS attacks from malicious PDF files. This ensures that any HTML generated by the package is safe to render in a browser.
- **Dependency Vulnerabilities:** Updated the `brace-expansion` dependency to resolve a low-severity vulnerability.
